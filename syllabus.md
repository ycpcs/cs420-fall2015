###Course Description

This course provides an introduction to the fundamentals of operating systems. Topics include interprocess communication, process scheduling, deadlock, memory management, virtual memory, file systems, and distributed systems. Formal principles are illustrated with examples and case studies of one or more contemporary operating systems. Also, students will study a widely used operating system such as Windows or UNIX with an emphasis on system programming for the operating system. Topics include kernel design, the I/O system, scheduling algorithms, process control, interprocess communication, system calls, and memory management.


**Prerequisites:**	CS340 or ECE260 with a grade of 2.0 or higher<br>
**Credit:**		3 credit hours<br>
**Text:**		Operating System Concepts, 9th Edition by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter B. Galvin, and Greg Gagne<br>



------------------
###Course Objectives

In this course students will learn:

  - Introduce the fundamental functionality and structure of operating systems
  - Discuss process scheduling schemes including synchronization, communication, and protection 
  - Discuss I/O interfacing focusing primarily on file system organization and access 
  - Illustrate concepts as implemented in modern OS’s including WinXP and Linux

------------------
###Late Policy

All assignments must be submitted by the specified due date. Solutions will be posted on the course web site after the due date. Late submissions will not be accepted, not even for partial credit. If you have some valid reason for needing more time on an assignment, then you should contact me at least two days before the deadline to request an extension. Last-minute requests will only be met in exceptional circumstances. If you cannot complete the entire assignment on time, you should submit what you have done by the specified due date for partial credit.



------------------
###Attendance Policy

Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes and participate in class activities and discussions. If a student is planning to miss a class, please notify the professor in advance. Each student is responsible for all of the material covered in class, regardless of whether or not the student attended class. Students are also expected to keep up with all assigned readings and have read them prior to attending class.


------------------
###Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to discuss course material with other students. Discussing the text, lecture notes, assignments and their solutions, is a great way to expose yourself to different approaches to thinking about the material. For many of the problems assigned in this class there will be no single right answer. Comparing multiple solutions to the same problem can help you to develop of much deeper understanding of the material. However, everything that you turn in must be your own work, unless instructed otherwise. If you work on assignments with another student or students, you need to explicitly list those students on the work you submit. If you found information on a website or in other materials (books, papers, etc.) then cite them as well. There is no penalty for naming who you worked with or listing other references. However, you will lose credit if you do not list someone with whom you collaborated, or other resources. You are not allowed to copy answers or parts of answers from anyone else, or from material you find on the Internet or elsewhere. This will be considered as willful cheating, and will be dealt with as a violation of the Academic Integrity code.


------------------
###Academic Integrity

York College’s mission statement stipulates that strict adherence to principles of academic honesty is expected of all students.  Therefore, academic dishonesty will not be tolerated at York College.  Academic dishonesty refers to actions such as, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabricating research, falsifying academic documents, etc., and includes all situations where students make use of the work of others and claim such work as their own.

Academic dishonesty will result in a '0' at minimum for all involved work and possible removal from the course at the discretion of the professor.  A written report of the circumstances and disciplinary action will be provided to the student.  A copy of this report will also be forwarded to the Dean of Academic Affairs which may result in suspension from the college for repeat offenses.  Students have the right to challenge any such actions through the normal appeals procedure.  Students are not permitted to withdraw from a course in which they have been accused of academic dishonesty.


------------------
###Personal Technology Policy

While York College recognizes students’ need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDAs, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate.  The college recognizes and supports faculty members’ authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.


------------------
###Communication Standards

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers.  Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations.  In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking.  Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.


------------------
###Students with Disabilities

If you are a student with a disability in need of a classroom accommodation and have not already registered with Linda Miller, Director of Disability Support Services, please contact her at 815-1785 or [lmille18@ycp.edu](mailto:lmille18@ycp.edu) to discuss policies and procedures related to disability services and to establish the accommodations for which you are eligible.
